      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
      <p>For quite a while now I've wanted to start a small blog/teaching platform where I try to give some intuition for various concepts in math, so that's what most of the website will be. To start, a little about myself.
        I'm currently doing a master's of science in mathematics at Simon Fraser University and did my bachelors of mathematics at the University of Waterloo where I majored in Pure Mathematics/Teaching, and minored in computer science
        and psychology. I also completed a diploma in Chinese language, 可是我的中文说得不太好。
      </p>
      <p>I'm also a part time high school maths and computer science teacher and I've designed asychronus courses for the school that I work at. That being said, I don't plan to cover any high school level maths here, although my goal is for most
        of the content that I make to be approachable for students in grade 11 or 12.
      </p>
      <p>If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at james_houle@sfu.ca. Also, if anyone knows a better way to type LaTeX in html, other than KaTeX, please let me know.</p>
