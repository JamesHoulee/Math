    <h1>Math Beyond Numbers Workshop</h1>
        <p>Description to come.</p>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>
            In the first week, we'll just meet to go over what the workshop is, what it isn't, get to know the people who are attending the workshop, and I'll show
            anyone who's interested how to do a peyote stitch. The peyote stitch is the stitch that I'll be referencing the most in the workshop - it lends itself really
            nicely to more geometric beadings, and we can explore some interesting ideas from group theory using this stitch.
        </p>
        <b>What is this workshop?</b>
        <p>
            My vision for Math Beyond Numbers is to explore ideas from Group Theory, one of my favourite areas of math, through hands-on activities and discussions. We'll
            be trying to draw from Indigenous cultures, primarily through bead work, to see these abstract math ideas in a more concrete way.
        </p>
        <b>What this workshop isn't.</b>
        <p>
            This isn't a beading workshop. While we will primarily be using bead work to explore these ideas, this is a math workshop. I will be
            here to support your ideas with which ever stitch that you choose to use, but I only know the one stitch and can only really help with this one.
